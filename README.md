# L2-Spanish-gender-assignment
This repository contains the Python and R code for the analyses presented in the article in Borealis.
The code included in this repository was created by Maura Cruz Enríquez, professor at Université TÉLUQ and the principal investigator of the project. Although not a professional programmer, she has formal training in computer science courses at the Université de Montréal (Introduction to Programming: C, C++, Java; Web Programming), and has also completed independent training in Python, Natural Language Processing, and statistics with R through platforms such as Codecademy and Udemy.
The scripts were developed with the assistance of programming-support tools such as Copilot and ChatGPT, which were used to refine syntax, check functions, and ensure reproducibility.
All analyses were conducted using RStudio (for R scripts) and Spyder (for Python scripts).
The code was used to analyze a corpus of L2 Spanish, which presents specific challenges for automatic corpus analysis. Learner productions often contain grammatical errors that differ from those found in native data, requiring additional care in data cleaning and linguistic annotation.
Researchers—especially those without extensive programming experience—are encouraged to run the scripts step by step, reviewing each stage manually to ensure that outputs are linguistically meaningful and that errors typical of L2 data are properly handled.
